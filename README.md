# An almost simple server in Express.js

This project will allow you to practise writing HTTP GET requests in Express.js

## What you will be doing

This project will allow you to practise using:

> Express.js

This project assumes you've already had experience with:

> JavaScript APIs (Math, Date)

## Tasks

### Task 1 - Getting ready

1. Initialise npm into your project
   `npm init -y`
2. Install the express.js npm package
   `npm i express`
3. Create a file for your server (`server.js`)

### Task 2 - Setting up your server

Use the snippet **starter code** to initialise your `server.js` file

### Task 3 - Add a GET request to '/hello'

Using the snippet **GET request**, write some HTTP request that will respond to the path (endpoint) `/hello`

This HTTP request should return a `response` with a message of greetings.

### Task 4 - Add a GET request to '/time'

Using the snippet **GET request**, write some HTTP request that will respond to the path (endpoint) `/time`

This request should return a `response` with the current time and date

### Task 5 - Add a GET request to '/random'

Using the snippet **GET request**, write some HTTP request that will respond to the path (endpoint) `/random`

This request should return a `response` with the random number
